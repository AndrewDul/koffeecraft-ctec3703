# KoffeeCraft – Dev Notes (Troubleshooting)

## 1) AAR metadata / compileSdk mismatch
**Issue:** Build failed with AAR metadata errors (some AndroidX dependencies required API 36+).  
**Fix:** Updated `compileSdk` (and `targetSdk`) to 36 to satisfy dependency requirements.

## 2) Adaptive icon requires API 26+
**Issue:** Android resource linking failed for `<adaptive-icon>` in `mipmap-anydpi` because adaptive icons require API 26+.  
**Fix:** Set `minSdk` to 26 (or alternatively, icons could be moved to `mipmap-anydpi-v26`).

## 3) Database Inspector showed "Nothing to show"
**Issue:** App Inspection → Database Inspector initially displayed no databases.  
**Fix:** Triggered database creation with a simple DAO query (e.g., count admins/products) during development to ensure the database file is created and visible in App Inspection.
